As we work today on deterministic machines, these numbers are not entirely random; instead, their generation procedure depends on a seed. Hence, today the random numbers we use are deterministically specified, often via the CPU clock time. This has disadvantages but brings one advantage; We can set a seed to enable reproducible results. We suggest to always, always set a seed. Moreover, we recommend testing the variance introduced by different seeds because your final conclusions in your paper should not depend on the seed."
